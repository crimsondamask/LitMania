She reclines on her bed like a Florentine maiden, 
And looks at me with her demanding eyes 
I can see her thinly veiled nipples harden, 
So I try to mount the bed on which she lies. 

From under the sheets she draws a shiny knife
She makes me watch as she cuts her palms
She tells me that, perhaps I should fear for my life
But between her legs I want to chant my psalms

A poem.
